                    Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king
                    who spent all day lounging on his throne. One day, his advisors
                    came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.
    </p><p>
                    Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the
                    night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the king's
                    pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was
                    furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.
    </p><p>
                    And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the
                    jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn't help but
                    laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't stop.
